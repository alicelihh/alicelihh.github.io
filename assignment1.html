            <p>
                This schematic shows three individual circuits. Each has a 100 ohm resistor and a green LED light

            <p>
                This is the calculations I used to determine the size of the resistors.

            <h3>Circuit</h3>
            <img src="circuit.png" width="400">
            <p>
                An Arduino board was used to connect the circuits. The Arduino board is attached to my computer, which provides code instructions.
