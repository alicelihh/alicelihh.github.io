            <h3>Schematic</h3>
            <img src="schematic.png" width="400">
            <p>
                In this schematic, three green LED lights are connected to three different pins, 8, 12 and 13. Each of the pin provides a 5v power. All three LEDs are in series with a resistor which is 330 ohm. All three series are connected to ground.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Calculations</h3>
            <pre>
                Power = 5.0v, Desired Current = 20mA = 0.02A
                Red, Green LED = 1.8v Drop
                V = 5.0v - 1.8v = 3.2v
                R = V/I = 3.2v / 0.02A = 160 ohm

            </pre>
            <p>
                I used the ohm's law to calculate the appropriate resistor to use. The resistor should be at least 160 ohm. I chose 330 ohm for this assignment.
            </p>
            <h3>Circuit</h3>
            <img src="circuit.png" width="400">
            <p>
                I used an Arduino board to control the blinking speed of my LEDs. The Arduino board is connected to my computer for power source. Three pins, 13, 12 and 8, are used to connect LED lights. In each series, the and LED is also connected to a resistor. All series are connected to the ground in the end.
