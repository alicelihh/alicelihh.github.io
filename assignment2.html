            <h3>Schematic</h3>

            <p>
                In this schematic, one green LED light is connected to pin 11, with a resister controlling the current. A button and resistor is connected to 5V power source, and parallel with a pin 2 connection.
            </p>

            <h3>Calculations</h3>
            <img src="calculations1.jpg" width="400">
            <p>
                I used the ohm's law to calculate the appropriate resistor to use. The resistor should be at least 160 ohm. I chose 330 ohm for this assignment.
                For the button, I chose a 1k resistor, because as long as there's current, the button works.
            </p>
            <h3>Circuit</h3>
            <img src="circuit1.jpg" width="400">
            <p>
                I used an Arduino board for powering the LED and pushbutton. The Arduino board is connected to my computer for power source. Pin 11 is connected to the resistor and LED, and pin 2 is in parallel with a pushbutton circuit. The pushbutton receives power from the Arduino Board.

                      analogWrite(11, i);

            <h3>Circuit Operation</h3>
            <p>
                This gif shows the operation of the circuit. With the first LED fading until the button is pushed. When the button is pushed, the LED starts blinking.
