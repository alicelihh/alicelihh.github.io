            <p>
                In this schematic, a transistir is connected to pin 9, with one end connected to a resister controlling the current, and the other one to a LED strip. The LED strip is connected to a 12v power source. A light sensor and resistor is connected to 5V power source, and voltage divided to input A0.

            <h3>Calculations</h3>

            <p>
                There are in total of 93 LEDs. I calculated the current, 0.458A that the circuit could hold. I used the ohm's law to calculate the appropriate resistor to use. The resistor should be at least 600 and 250 ohm. I chose 10k ohm resistors for this assignment.

            <h3>Circuit</h3>
            <img src="circuit4.jpg" width="400">
            <p>
                I used an Arduino board control the light sensor and LEDs. The Arduino board is connected to my computer for power source. Pin 9 is connected to the resistor and LEDs, and the power pin (5v) is connected to the light sensor. The light sensor is voltage diverged to input pin A0.

                  // converter to settle after the last reading:
                  delay(2);
                }

            <h3>Circuit Operation</h3>
            <p>
                This gif shows the operation of the circuit. With the first LED mapping to the light sensor, when the sensor is dark (covered), the LEDs will light up (brighter).
