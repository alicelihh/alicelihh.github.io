        Hello everyone!

        This technical documentation will guide you through my final project - LuminWall. Before we go into the
        implementation of this project, I would like to provide some background information and concept.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                <pre>
        For seniors, falling could result in major injuries or even death. Seniors are likely to fall during night time
        when they wake up during their sleep. It is important for seniors to be able to see well of the surroundings
        to prevent accidents. To improve the lighting system of homes, this report will propose  a  lighting  system
        that  is  more  accessible  to  seniors  and  perhaps  use  a  different  control  system. This lighting
        system will be connected to the walls of the home. Unlike current lighting systems, where light switches
        are the only interface for turning on lights, this new lighting system will extend the switch to the whole
        surface of the wall.
        </pre>
            </p>
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                <pre>
        LuminWall can conceptually reduce the risk of finding a switch in the dark, which reduce senior night falls.
        In addition, LuminWall introduces a new variation of switch control. Looking into the feature, designers and
        engineers should not be limited to one variation of ON/OFF switch.

        The project uses Capacitive Sensing, which requires little or no force to activate. The sensor plate and your
        body forms a capacitor. A capacitor stores charge. The more its capacitance, the more charge it can store.
        The capacitance of this capacitive touch sensor depends on how close your hand is to the plate. The Arduino
        measures how much time the capacitor (i.e the touch sensor) takes to charge, giving it an estimate of the
        capacitance. Using the variation of time, we can create a touch-based sensing system.
